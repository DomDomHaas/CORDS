Subject: **Workshops on reproducible research, data pipelines and scientific computing in Spring**

Dear WSL-folks,

we would like to draw your attention to a few workshops at WSL on reproducible research, data pipelines and scientific computing running at the beginning of next Summer.
One workshop will be on reproducible research and data pipelines, intended for anyone who programmatically handles data and/or runs simulations to make their programming and data-workflow reproducible.  Then there is a set of workshops on scientific computing with topics _Solving partial differential equations on GPUs_ and _Geospacial data processing with Python_.
These workshops are funded through the WSL internal project CORDS [1].

Workshop on Reproducible Research and Data Pipelines:
- code handling and version control (with git)
- software dependency management (virtual environments)
- input/output data handling
  - in particular automated data-download and storage
  - fully automatic production of all of a project's outputs
- we will teach a simple, low-tech approach, i.e. only your programming-language and git will be used (there are many more advanced tools, which can be learned once a foundation is made)
- workshop of 2 days of 7h (9:00-12:30 13:30-17:00)

Workshop on Solving Partial Differential Equations on Graphical Processing Units (GPUs)
- runs for one afternoon
- uses a Julia-based approach to GPU computing, see https://pde-on-gpu.vaw.ethz.ch/
- partial differential equations are solved with matrix-free method scaling to supercomputers
- also applicable for general stencil-based computations on large datasets, e.g. filtering

Workshop on Geospacial Data Processing
- runs for one afternoon
- Python-based
- ???

For all workshops:
- teaching via hands-on exercises and projects
- based on scripting language (Python, Julia, Matlab or R)

We hope to see you at the workshops!
