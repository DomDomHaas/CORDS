Subject: **Workshops on reproducible research, data pipelines and scientific computing**

Dear WSL-folks,

we would like to draw your attention to a workshop/course at WSL on reproducible research and data pipelines running next Spring.  The workshop is intended for anyone who programmatically handles data and/or runs simulations to make their data-workflow reproducible.  This workshop is funded through the WSL internal project CORDS [1].

Workshop aims:
- code handling and version control (with git)
- software dependency management (virtual environments)
- input/output data handling
  - in particular automated data-download and storage
  - fully automatic production of all of a project's outputs

Workshop structure & philosophy:
- workshop of 2 days of 7h (9:00-12:30 13:30-17:00)
- teaching via hands-on exercises and projects
- based on scripting language (Python, Julia, Matlab or R)
- we will teach a simple, low-tech approach, i.e. only your programming-language and git will be used (there are many more advanced tools, which can be learned once a foundation is made)

Interested?  Sign up or just declare your interest at

Future outlook: There will be a further part to the workshop, Scientific Computing, with three parallel track topics: GPU-based physical simulation, large dataset processing on GPUs, and spatial data processing pipelines in Python.  This part is independent of the here advertised part. Information to follow.

We hope to see you at the workshop!
