# The toy-project tasks

# FINISH TODOs!

For the high-level overview, see [The toy research problem](the-toy-research-project.md).

For detail on the model, see [The mass balance model](the-mass-balance-model.md).

## T01: Start coding a glacier mass balance model: the melt function
- make a folder `CORDS` somewhere, where all the material of this course will end up
- make a file `CORDS/melt.*` in your favourite programming language and program the melt function
  - see [The mass balance model: melt function](TODO)
  - be sure to follow the function naming and API (application programming interface, here just a fancy way of saying make the function take the suggested arguments in the right order)

## T02: Team up with someone, create a git repository on GitHub and add the melt function to the repo

- make teams of two, programming the same language (the spreadsheet with the infos should help)
- on one person's Github account make a repository named `breithorn-toy-project-CORDS`
- give write access to the other person: "Settings" -> "Collaborators"
- make
- decide on
