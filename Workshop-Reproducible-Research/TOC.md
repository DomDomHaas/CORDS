# Table of contents of the reproducible research workshop CORDS
L1 == Lecture 1; T3 == Task 3

Note that the video recording can be found
[here](https://people.ee.ethz.ch/~werderm/rere-data/video.html), with chapters corresponding to below lectures and to some of the tasks.

The material should be studied row by row of the table.

Lectures may have both slides and long-form material.  If so, the latter is linked below with a [2].
