## Wrap up and outlook

Looked at many aspects of how to make science reproducible
  - code handling
  - data handling
  - best practices

We did this in a project-based way, hopefully this means that things will stick better ;-)

We produced some tools which maybe of use to you in future projects:
- download function
- git-hash storage function
- (maybe) the cache function

### Outlook

Where should you go from here?

Methods and approach learned here should be sufficient for not too complicated research projects

If your projects are complicated, consider
- writing some more tools yourself
- start using a bunch of existing tools low level tools (such as pipelining software)
- start learning and using an integrated solution

"This is a very complicated case, Maude.
A lotta ins, a lotta outs.
Fortunately, I'm adhering to a pretty strict drug regimen to **keep my mind limber**."

â€” The Dude, The Big Lebowski (1998)
