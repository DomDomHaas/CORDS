## Licenses, what are those?

In general, all creative works are copyrighted to the creator (this maybe the company one works for).  This give the creator exclusive rights to use, distribute, etc that work. This also means that no-one else can use it; this is against reproducible (and open) research, as one cannot reproduce if one cannot use.

Thus, to make work available to others a license is granted to use said work.  This maybe a commercial licence or a free and open source license (ok, there are many terms).

To make your science openly available you should publish your work (software, hardware, data, papers, etc.) under a free license.

## Aright, aright, what license?

I suggest to use nonrestrictive licenses as that allows other to use your work without headaches

- for text and data creative commons [CC-By](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0)
- for code the one typically used by the respective software community.  Good ones are:
  - [MIT](https://opensource.org/license/mit)
- more restrictive open licenses of the share-alike variety often cause problems with incompatibility
- avoid un-free open-ish licences like the non-commercial ones
