## Publish your open science

Once you've written the publication, or maybe before, it is time to publish your results including how to reproduce them.

- re-clone your code-repository, ideally onto a new computer
- run the master script, this will populate
  - data
  - results
- go through data
  - probably delete the foreign-data
  - probably delete intermediate results (cached stuff)
  - in the own-data, check that this data can all be published
- ideally make the own-data download url point to the upcoming data-repository
  (but this might not be possible up-front); alternatively remove them/comment them out
- double check that the project-README is in a state which makes sense for a data-repository
- double check that you include a LICENSE
- check that you got the ok from all copyright holders that the publication under this license is okey
- send it off the repository
