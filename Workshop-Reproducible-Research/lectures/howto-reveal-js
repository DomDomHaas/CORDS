We use reveal.js for presenting the slides (all files *._slides.md).

1) Install https://github.com/webpro/reveal-md

2) Run with

./run-slides.sh your.md

This uses the configurations in custom.css and front-matter.yml, so no
- yaml front matter is needed in the markdown files
- style customisation is in custom.css
