### Recording

This workshop will be recorded and we plan to edit it and make the lecture-bits available on youtube (but not the in-between hands-on work). We will only film toward the speaker.

--> if you don't want to be heard on film, only ask questions after the lectured-bits

--> if you don't want to be on film: don't run up to the stage / turn off your camera if on Zoom

### Reproducible Research Workshop structure

The workshop is aimed to be hands-on as much as possible.  The plan is to have
- short lectures on key topics
- longer hands-on session to implement what was discussed on a toy research project

The course material is on Github:
https://github.com/mauro3/cords

We have implementation of the toy research project in Julia and Python, linked in above repo.

You can follow this course in another language, but with less support from our side.
