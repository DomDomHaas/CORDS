# Reproducible Research Course

This is a hands-on workshop on reproducible research.  Here we provide the lectured content and the instructions for the hands-on project which will be coded as we advance through the workshop.

Overview of the online material for self-study:
- the best entry point is the [Table of contents](TOC.md).  In particular:
  - lectures are found [here](https://github.com/mauro3/CORDS/tree/master/Workshop-Reproducible-Research/lectures); note that for some lectures there is a `*_slides.md` file, which are the slides, and a long-form `*.md` file.
  - the toy research project is described in the [task.md](https://github.com/mauro3/CORDS/blob/master/Workshop-Reproducible-Research/tasks/tasks.md) file
- [video recording](https://people.ee.ethz.ch/~werderm/rere-data/video.html) of the lectures and task descriptions
- repositories implementing the toy research project:
  - https://github.com/vboussange/rere
